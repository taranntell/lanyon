In companies where most colleagues use Microsoft Windows, shared network drives and file paths are deeply established—widely known, used daily, and central to internal collaboration. Unfortunately, these paths often don’t translate well for Mac users.

As one of the few using macOS, I regularly ran into the same issue: converting Windows file paths to macOS-friendly formats. This is especially true when accessing resources over the network via [Samba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_(software)), which I depend on daily and deeply appreciate. But copying `\\server\share\folder` into Finder or Terminal just doesn’t work without converting it to an `smb://` URL first—a small but constant frustration.

**Kasimba** is a lightweight macOS utility that simplifies this: it converts Windows-style file paths into SMB URLs that just work on a Mac.

### Features

- Convert UNC paths (`\\server\share\folder`) to SMB URLs (`smb://server/share/folder`)
- Convert Windows drive paths (e.g. `C:\folder\file.txt`) with a configurable default server
- Copy converted paths to the clipboard with one click
- Open SMB paths directly in Finder
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick actions (⌘⇧C to copy, ⌘O to open)
- Clean, native macOS interface built with SwiftUI

Kasimba is built entirely in Swift and SwiftUI. It requires macOS 13.0 or later. It's open source—feel free to use it, suggest improvements, or contribute:
